## General Approach

We wanted to create an app that is simple to navigate and allows users to create an account. Our main focus for the app is to have it look clean and appealing for all users. In order to achieve our goal and meet the user stories, React was the ideal library to use. It has reusable components and also allows the use of Router for navigating between pages of your app.

## User Stories

* As a user, I would like to create an account.
* As a user, I would like the app to tell me if my inputs are invalid or does not meet the requirements.
* As a user, I would like the app to confirm my first name and email inputs in the confirmation page.
* As a user, I would like the form to dynamically adjust when my screen size changes.
